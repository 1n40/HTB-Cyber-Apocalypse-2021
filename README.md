## 📈 Conclusion
This CTF gave an opportunity to learn a lot and explore almost all kinds of fields. I loved **reverse engineering** and **forensics**, especially the one which was a typical malware analysis challenge ([Invitation](Forensics/Invitation)). I had no idea about hardware challenges and now this has given me an opportunity to learn hardware. Also, it reflected how much I know and where I stand; still a lot to learn!
